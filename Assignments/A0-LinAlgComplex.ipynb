    "# Some Jupyter Tricks\n",
    "Jupyter is an interactive interface that runs a Python \"kernel\" in the background, one of 3 possible kernels (other 2 being Julia and R). Each cell can be run (executed) separately, but they populate the same \"name space\", i.e., not independent. If you initialize and do some operations on a variable in one cell, and change it in another, that will affect the initial cell. It's similar to cells in a MATLAB script. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, keep track of when and where you ran code, and before you submit anything final, __ALWAYS kill the notebook and re-run everything from the top__ to make sure there weren't some loose variables defined somewhere else!\n",

    "- Enter to enter edit mode (can enter text); ESC to enter command mode.\n",

    "    - A to open a new cell above, B to open one below, X to delete current cell.\n",
    "    - M to change the cell to Markdown (fancy text, non-executable). Markdown is how all these instructions are written, and also where you will provide short-form responses in all the assignments. There are a lot more ways of formatting than plaintext, for example, __bold__.\n",
    "- Shift-Enter to run a cell, which will execute the code, or set the Markdown text\n",
