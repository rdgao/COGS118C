Using Euler's formula, we can separate the complex exponential into a real (cosine) and an imaginary (sine) component.

The real ingenuity behind the Fourier Transform is that a signal - *any signal* - can be decomposed into contributions from sinusoidal components (or bases), if you pick the right frequencies.

    "# [+2 Bonus] Negative Frequencies & Aliasing - A Caveat\n",
    "In the plot below, I plotted the computed wave frequency of all the wave numbers using your function (blue), as well as using numpy's function (orange). From k=0 to 1250, the two lines should overlap (if your function is doing the right thing). After 1250Hz, however, your function should keep returning increasing wave frequencies for increasing wave number, while numpy returns **negative** frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, in the strange clock example, a negative frequency would be when the hand rotates **counterclockwise**. For wave number `k=N-1`, for example, after a single time step, you can picture that as the hand jumping clockwise **almost** all the way around the full circle, to the last tick mark. OR, you can picture it as the hand jumping a single step counterclockwise, to -1/N. Because everything we work with is in discrete time, these two scenarios are indistinguishable, and the boundary at which this phenomenon occurs is at `k=N/2`, which corresponds to `fs/2`. This is known as the **Nyquist frequency**, and it's where sinusoidal rotations start to appear as if they are rotating backwards. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNftf5qLpiA) for a visual demonstration. This is also what gives rise to **aliasing**, which we will explore in detail in the last section.\n",
    "\n",
    "[BONUS: 2] Uncomment the code below. Write a modified version of your `freq_from_k` function inside `freq_from_k_nyq` such that it returns negative wave frequencies for frequencies greater than the Nyquist frequency. Call the function and store the result in `your_freqs_nyq`, and plot it in the same plot. It should overlap completely with the numpy result."

Almost every lab on campus that works with EEG, ECoG, or LFPs will at some point compute a power spectrum to look for rhythmic signals, including Profs.

By the Nyquist sampling theorem, we know that for a signal of frequency B, we have to sample at least 2B Hz. In other words, if the sampling rate is fs, the highest frequency signal we can resolve is fs/2, which is called the Nyquist frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, our downsampled signal is sampled at 20Hz, which means we can resolve a signal of at most 10Hz. Remember the weird clocks? Well, if a 14Hz signal sampled at 20Hz is like rotating around the circle clockwise 14 times per second, it will produce the same sequence of clock positions as if it's rotating around the circle counterclockwise 6 times per second, or -6Hz. The math is $14-20 = -6$\n",
